"It's very easy to make some words [1mbold[22m and other words [3mitalic[23m with Markdown. You can even [34mlink to Google! ([34m[4mhttp://google.com[24m[39m[34m)[39m

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

    1. One
    2. Two
    3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

    * Start a line with a star
    * Profit!

Alternatively,

    * Dashes work just as well
    * And if you have sub points,
      put two spaces before the dash or star:
        * Like this
        * And this
    * Lorem
        * Ipsum
        * Dolor

But also,

    1. And not to forget
       numbered lists
        1. Can also have
        2. Several sub points

[35m[4m[1m# Structured documents[22m[24m[39m

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a [33m#[39m to create headings. Multiple [33m##[39m in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

[32m[1m### This is a third-tier heading[22m[39m

You can use one [33m#[39m all the way up to [33m######[39m six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

[90m[3m    Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.[23m[39m
[90m[3m    - Captain Janeway[23m[39m

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: [33mvar example = true[39m.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    [33mif (isAwesome){[39m
    [33m  return true[39m
    [33m}[39m

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

    [33mif (isAwesome){[39m
    [33m  return true[39m
    [33m}[39m

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

    <JS_START>if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }<JS_END>

"
`;
