[0mSometimes you want numbered lists:[0m

    1. [0mOne[0m
    2. [0mTwo[0m
    3. [0mThree[0m

[0mSometimes you want bullet points:[0m

    * [0mStart a line with a star[0m
    * [0mProfit![0m

[0mAlternatively,[0m

    * [0mDashes work just as well[0m
    * [0mAnd if you have sub points,[0m
      [0mput two spaces before the dash or star:
        * [0m[0mLike this[0m[0m[0m

[35m[4m[1m# Structured documents[22m[24m[39m

[0mSometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a [33m#[39m to create headings. Multiple [33m##[39m in a row denote smaller heading sizes.[0m

[32m[1m### This is a third-tier heading[22m[39m

[0mYou can use one [33m#[39m all the way up to [33m######[39m six for different heading sizes.[0m

[0mIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:[0m

[90m[3m    [0mCoffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.[0m[23m[39m
[90m[3m    [0m- Captain Janeway[0m[23m[39m

[0mThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: [33mvar example = true[39m.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:[0m

    [33mif (isAwesome){[39m
    [33m  return true[39m
    [33m}[39m

[0mGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:[0m

    [33mif (isAwesome){[39m
    [33m  return true[39m
    [33m}[39m

[0mAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:[0m

    [36mif[39m (isAwesome){
      [36mreturn[39m [36mtrue[39m
    }
